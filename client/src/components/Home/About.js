        <h2> <FaBookOpen />All About Nairobi</h2>
        <p>It's no surprise that Nairobi is recognized as the safari capital of Africa given that a national park is right outside its door and that wildlife abounds there. Nairobi is home to some of the best gardens and parks in the nation, and lush forests are only a short distance from the city. As a result, the capital of Kenya offers outdoor recreation both within the city and on the outskirts. And while the city's neighborhoods are certainly worth visiting, its proximity to nature may be its biggest draw. The majority of Nairobi's eateries and bars are located in Westlands, which lies to the north of the city center. Karen is a more affluent neighborhood featuring premium boutiques and posh bistros. The entrance to Nairobi National Park is at Langata, which also houses the city's waterpark and a well-known museum.<br />
        Visit the City Park Market to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables and sample regional specialties like nyama choma (roasted meat, frequently goat), which is served with kachumbari (onion and tomato salad with chilli). Maasai Market, where you can purchase authentic East African products including handwoven baskets, beaded jewelry, and fabrics, is another market you shouldn't miss.</p>

      <h3> <FaCalendarCheck /> When is the best time to stay <br />  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;in a vacation rental in Nairobi?</h3>
      <p>In comparison to other African cities, Nairobi has comparatively pleasant weather year-round due to its high elevation. The best time to rent a home in Nairobi is between June and October during the dry season, when you can anticipate bright days with low danger of precipitation. It's also the ideal time of year to view Nairobi National Park's plethora of animals.<br />
      The Madaraka Day festival, which honors Kenya's self-rule, takes place in June, and the city comes to life with music, cuisine, and dancing. From December to early March, when temperatures are at their warmest, you may anticipate hot, dry days with chilly evenings. Mid-March through May are the rainy months of the city, with a shorter period in November and December.</p>

      <h4> <FaRegBookmark /> What are the top things <br />to do in Nairobi?</h4>
      <p> <b> Nairobi national park <br /> </b>
Nairobi National Park is located outside of the city, where animals can graze free against the backdrop of the city skyline. In addition to the most endangered black rhinos in the world, the 45-acre park is also home to lions, hyenas, cheetahs, leopards, zebras, and giraffes. Also, this national park features a sizable wetland region that serves as a sanctuary for more than 400 different bird species. On a guided safari driving trip or a safari walk, you can take in everything.<br /> <br />
 <b >Karura Forest <br /></b>
The serene Karura Forest, one of the world's largest urban woods, is located just outside of Nairobi. More than 2,000 acres of woodland contain streams, waterfalls, and lovely walking and bicycling trails. More than 200 different species of birds, antelopes, monkeys, and other native animals call this forest home.<br /> <br /> 
<b>Nairobi National museum <br /></b>
Spend a few hours exploring the Nairobi National Museum’s collection of artwork and cultural pieces from some of Kenya’s finest local artists. The highlight is the museum’s paleontology gallery, where you can see a large collection of hominid fossils, and bones from hundreds of local birds and mammals. The museum sits within a botanical garden containing many local medicinal plants and herbs.</p>
